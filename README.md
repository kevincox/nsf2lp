A tool to convert the new (json) sourceforge bug export to launchpad import format.

Currently it is really simple but it works.  If it doesn't work for you there are a couple of things you might need to do.
- If you use different statuses than me you will need to add them to the statusconv map.
- If you use different severities than me you will need to add them to the sevconv map.
- If you named your severities field different you will need to change it.

If you add more severities and priorities please send me a pull request.

If you make improvements please send me a pull request.

I am not responsible for any lost information.

Cheers! And best of luck.
